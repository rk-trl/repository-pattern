# repository-pattern

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development to abstract and encapsulate the data access logic from the rest of the application. It provides a consistent and organized way to interact with data storage mechanisms such as databases, APIs, and file systems. The main goal of the Repository Pattern is to create a separation between the data access code and the higher-level business logic, making the application more maintainable and testable.
